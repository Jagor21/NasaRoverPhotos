This is a project used to implement and explain several topics in Android Development. The idea is to share through different 
commits and branches different implementations regarding the use of frameworks, patterns and good practices. 
Almost all of the work will have some written articles trying to explain everything.

For this branch, the article can be found [here](https://proandroiddev.com/implementing-an-android-app-with-jetpack-mvvm-ui-state-manage-and-some-other-interesting-stuff-e965b420f5a8), 
where all the logic to implement the application that uses Jetpack, MVVM + UI State (â€¦ and some other interesting stuff) is explained.
